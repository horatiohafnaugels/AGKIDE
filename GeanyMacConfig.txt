This may not be the best way to do it but after much trial and error it is what worked for me.

GTK setup

Download https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-osx/raw/master/gtk-osx-setup.sh to your home directory and run it: 
    
$ sh gtk-osx-setup.sh

It will install jhbuild in ~/Source and create ~/.new_local/bin/jhbuild

Add the following lines to ~/.config/jhbuildrc-custom in place of the existing setup_sdk() function

setup_sdk(target="10.9", architectures=["x86_64"])
setup_release()

now run the following commands

$ ~/.new_local/bin/jhbuild bootstrap-gtk-osx
$ ~/.new_local/bin/jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap
$ ~/.new_local/bin/jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-gtk2
$ ~/.new_local/bin/jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-themes
$ ~/.new_local/bin/jhbuild build gtk-mac-integration

you now have a reasonably complete GTK installation in your home directory ready for you to build the IDE


Geany IDE setup

Browse to the location of the IDE source code in the terminal and run the following command with the "../../" modified to point to your GTK installation created above (should be /Users/Me/gtk/) as far as I can tell these must be relative paths, absolute paths get a variable prepended to them

Note that if the packages have been updated since these instructions were written you may have to adjust the version numbers on these paths to match

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="../../../../../gtk/source/gtk+-2.24.32:../../../../../gtk/source/pango-1.46.2:../../../../../gtk/source/glib-2.66.0:../../../../../gtk/source/cairo-1.16.0:../../../../../gtk/source/pixman-0.40.0:../../../../../gtk/source/libpng-1.6.37:../../../../../gtk/source/gdk-pixbuf-2.40.0:../../../../../gtk/source/atk-2.36.0"

now run

$ export CXXFLAGS="-O2 -I$HOME/gtk/inst/include -I$HOME/gtk/inst/include/harfbuzz -I$HOME/gtk/inst/include/atk-1.0 -mmacosx-version-min=10.9 -march=x86-64"

$ export CFLAGS="-O2 -I$HOME/gtk/inst/include -I$HOME/gtk/inst/include/harfbuzz -I$HOME/gtk/inst/include/atk-1.0 -x objective-c -mmacosx-version-min=10.9 -march=x86-64"

$ export LIBS="-lgtkmacintegration-gtk2 -framework ApplicationServices -framework CoreFoundation -framework Cocoa -lgtk-quartz-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lpixman-1 -lz -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lm -lpng16"

$ export LDFLAGS="-O2 -L$HOME/gtk/inst/lib -mmacosx-version-min=10.9"

and finally run this with the prefix path set to where you want the final IDE executable to be, for your first attempt I recommend using this path, the bundler uses it later

$ sh ./autogen.sh --prefix="$HOME/Projects/Geany-Compiled" --disable-vte --disable-dependency-tracking

IDE building

All the above should only be done once, after that you can just browse to the IDE source in a terminal and run 
$ make
$ make install
to compile the IDE to a binary. Note that if you want to move the source files folder you will need to ./autogen.sh it again


IDE bundling

To make distribution easier it is best to bundle the binary into a .app file to do so install the gtk-mac-bundler from here https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/OSX/Bundling

Extract GeanyBundle.zip included with the IDE source so that it sits beside the IDE binary folder, e.g. $HOME/Projects/GeanyBundle to use the example above. Browse to this folder in the terminal then run

$ ~/.local/bin/jhbuild shell
$ export PATH=$PREFIX/bin:~/.local/bin:$PATH
$ gtk-mac-bundler AppGameKit.bundle

If you changed any of the paths above you may need to edit AppGameKit.bundle in a text editor to modify the paths, good luck!
